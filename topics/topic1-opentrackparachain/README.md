# Topic 1: Open Track - Build A Polkadot Native Project
> Mentor: Parity Technologies

In this category, we hope that you will be creative and **build the custom Substrate-based chain that you think is most useful to other builders of the Polkadot ecosystem!**. 

We don't expect fully productional level, but at least, you should be able to 

**1) build a parachain** 

**2) test your Substrate-based chain** using various developing tools like [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet).
